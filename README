PETOOH - a fundamentally new programming language.

Example: http://ideone.com/1Jenb

BASICS:

    Kudah   - increment the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the right).
    kudah	- decrement the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the left).
    Ko      - increment (increase by one) the byte at the data pointer.
    kO	    - decrement (decrease by one) the byte at the data pointer.
    Kukarek - output the byte at the data pointer as an ASCII encoded character.
    Kud     - if the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching ] command*.
    kud     - if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching [ command*.
